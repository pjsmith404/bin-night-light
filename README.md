# Bin Night Light

Here in my town we have three different bins for our rubbish:

- The red bin for general waste.
- The green bin for organic and food waste.
- The yellow bin for recyclables.

Every week our garbage gets collected on a Tuesday. However, only two bins get collected. The green bin always goes out, but the red and yellow alternate weeks. Occasionally, I will fail to sneak a peak at my neighbours' curbs and put out the wrong bin. This is quite vexing, because now I need to wait another 2 weeks to get a bin emptied that is probably already fairly full. My wife is unamused, I am unamused, my dog is unmoved. So! The plan here is to take the pile of electronics that can't fit in my overloaded bins and turn them into a useful reminder of which bin is meant to go out on which night.

# Achieving this goal

## Equipment

The following tools will be required:
- An **Arduino** to act as the brains of the operation.
- The guiding glow of **LEDs**.
- Some sort of module to help keep time. (Further research is required)
- Access to a wife with a 3D printer at work. Because what electronics project would be complete without a cute printed thing?

## The plan

1. **DONE** Get my Arduino programmable on whatever god forsaken operating system I'm using today.
2. **DONE** Get my Arduino operating an LED or two. I'll probably go for basic LEDs here, although something overly programmable could be fun.
3. Keep track of time with a time keeping module. I don't think Arduino's basic clock will be able to track dates in any particularly useful way. Although, it could be a fun maths problem.
4. Actually find out what day my bins are meant to go out on. This has proven a challenging task thus far.
5. Find a design for a small bin that will hold the Arduino and all its attachements.
6. Get said bin printed by my beautiful and loving wife.
