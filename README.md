# Bin Night Light

Here in my town we have three different bins for our rubbish:

- The red bin for general waste.
- The green bin for organic and food waste.
- The yellow bin for recyclables.

Every week our garbage gets collected on a Tuesday. However, only two bins get collected. The green bin always goes out, but the red and yellow alternate weeks. Occasionally, I will fail to sneak a peak at my neighbours' curbs and put out the wrong bin. This is quite vexing, because now I need to wait another 2 weeks to get a bin emptied that is probably already fairly full. My wife is unamused, I am unamused, my dog is unmoved. So! The plan here is to take the pile of electronics that can't fit in my overloaded bins and turn them into a useful reminder of which bin is meant to go out on which night.

The following tools will be required:
- An **Arduino** to act as the brains of the operation.
- The guiding glow of **LEDs**.
- Some sort of module to help keep time. (Further research is required)
- Access to a wife with a 3D printer at work. Because what electronics project would be complete without a cute printed thing?
